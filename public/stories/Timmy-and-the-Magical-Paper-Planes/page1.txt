Once upon a time in a little town filled with colorful houses and lush green gardens, there lived a young boy named Timmy. Timmy had a very special talent. Using an array of vibrant colored papers, he could fold the most amazing paper planes anyone had ever seen. Every day after school, Timmy would rush back home, climb up to his cozy attic filled with books, markers, and an infinite collection of paper sheets, and create new paper planes that soared through the skies.
