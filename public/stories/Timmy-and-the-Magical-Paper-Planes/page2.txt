One sunny afternoon, as Timmy was practicing in the park, one of his planes, the biggest heâ€™d ever made, took off into the sky and disappeared behind the clouds. Timmy chased after his plane until he reached the edge of the forest. There he found a magical creature, a tiny fairy named Lila, who had found his plane and brought it back to life. The fairy sprinkled magic dust on the paper plane, and it began to grow in size until it was large enough for Timmy to ride. Timmy climbed aboard, and together with Lila, they soared high above the town, spreading joy and wonder wherever they flew.
