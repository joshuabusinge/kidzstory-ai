Tommy was a curious and adventurous boy, always looking up at the night sky, dreaming of exploring the stars. One clear, starry night, he found an old, shiny rocket ship hidden in his backyard. With a grin on his face, he decided that tonight would be the night for his big adventure.

As the rocket rumbled to life, Tommy strapped himself in and prepared for take-off. Suddenly, the ground shook, and he felt his rocket soaring into the sky. Up, up, and away! He was zooming through the vast, twinkling expanse of space.

Tommy's first stop was the Moon. The surface was dusty and pale, with craters and mountains casting long shadows in the bright moonlight. He could see Earth glowing beautifully in the distance, like a blue and green jewel.
