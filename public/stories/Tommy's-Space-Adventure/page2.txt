Next, Tommy flew to Mars. The red planet was rocky and covered in reddish sand dunes. As he walked around, he met Marvin, a friendly Martian with sparkling green skin and three eyes. Marvin showed Tommy his Martian garden, where glowing plants grew in all sorts of unusual colors.

After saying goodbye to Marvin, Tommy continued his journey. He passed by the rings of Saturn, which glittered like a heavenly necklace. He even visited the icy world of Pluto, where he had a snowball fight with a jovial snowman named Chilly.

Finally, as much as Tommy loved exploring, he knew it was time to go home. He hopped back into his rocket and flew back to Earth, landing softly in his backyard. Tommy's heart was full of joy and wonder, knowing he would always remember his magical space adventure.
